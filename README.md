<h3>Hello & Welcome, </h3><br/>

My entrepreneurial work is housed inside a private GitHub repository. You can visit the live site at [Bodyboon](https://bodyboon.com/).<br/>

Technical Overview<br/>
- Production and beta sites are containerized and deployed to Google Cloud Run.<br/>
- I built the user authentication with Google's Firebase SDK, securing all HTTP requests with token authorization.<br/>
- I implemented payment processing with the Stripe SDK, and a custom REST API handles my JSON queries and webhook events.<br/>
- My front-end utilizes custom Lit (lit.dev) web components, and auto-detects state changes in the shadow DOM caused by user interaction before communicating changes the back-end.<br/>
- The back-end is an Express.js stateless architecture that interfaces with Firebase, Stripe and MongoDB to process and save user data in real-time.<br/>
- Core Functionality: Custom algorithms and data structures generate unique dietary recommendations based on user inputs (age, weight, height, sex, and activity levels).<br/> Features include custom recipe building by ingredient search, nutritional content analysis (covering 44 nutrients), and diet tracking to monitor daily nutrient intake against dietary goals.
