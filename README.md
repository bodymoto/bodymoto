<h3>Hello & Welcome, </h3><br/>

You may view my public repositories (below) to get a feel for my progression as a developer.

My largest development to-date is housed within a private repo on Github (visit www.bodyboon.com). It's a fullstack web application and SAAS offering supporting a small paying customer base. <br/><br/>
The project consists of three web sites, the home page (www.bodyboon.com), production ([app.bodyboon.com](app.bodyboon.com)) and beta (private).<br/><br/>
The home page is hosted on Firebase and consists of basic HTML/CSS for ease, speed, and SEO.<br/><br/>
The production/beta sites are containerized and deployed to a Google Cloud Run environment. User sign-up and authentication was built using Google's Firebase SDK and all http fetch requests use JWT token authorization middleware. The user checkout and payment processing was built using Stripe's SDK, using JSON queries and webhook events. Front-end JavaScript web components, Lit (lit.dev), auto-detect state changes to the shadow DOM caused by user interaction and communicate said changes using a REST API to Express.js back-end stateless architecture that speaks to MongoDB to save user data in real-time. The app itself consists of a suite of custom algorithms and manipulate custom data structures to generate unique dietary recommendations (based on a users age, weight, height, sex and activity levels), build custom recipes by searching for individual ingredients, analyzing recipes for nutritional content (44 nutrients in total), and tracking a user diet by logging recipes and showing total nutrient intake for the day and how close the user is to reaching dietary goals.
