<h3>Hello & Welcome, </h3><br/>

You may view my public repositories (below) to get a feel for my progression as a developer.

My largest project to-date is housed within a private repo (visit www.bodyboon.com). It's a fullstack SAAS MVP, built with Stripes SDK for payment processing, Firebase SDK for user authentication, MongoDB, Lit, Web components, Express, Webpack, Babel, Docker, and live, deployed to Google Cloud Run.

Cheers,

(っ˘ڡ˘ς) ♨ (๑ᵔ⤙ᵔ๑)<br/>
